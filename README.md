flexo
=====

A Javascript general-purpose library (used by Bender a.o.)

Use Mocha (`npm install mocha`) to run tests from the command line (`mocha
test/flexo.js`.) To run tests from a browser, also install Chai (`npm install
chai`) then open `test/flexo.html` in your browser. More documentation is
forthcoming; run the test page to get an idea of what to do.
